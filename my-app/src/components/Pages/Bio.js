                Hello! Welcome to my Photography page.
                I was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. I started studying
                photography in high school and continued through college, graduating 
                in 2017 from Watkins College of Art and Design with a Bachelorâ€™s of Fine Arts in Photography.
